# PyClash
A first open source Python 3.9 Clash of Clans Server for version 14.211.16!

## Client
To connect to your server, you need a custom client. Here the only solution is to use a [precompiled client](https://bit.ly/3G0BsPj)
Just edit the IP in the Frida-Gadget config (```/lib/armeabi-v7a/libxeon.config.so```)

### Friendly reminder
The server is in a most early. Right now, it is NOT recommended to run this on a production environment. Please not open issues about missing features, i'm well aware of this.
